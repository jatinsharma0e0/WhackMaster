## Converting from React

This game was successfully converted from a React/TypeScript implementation to pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript while preserving 100% of the original functionality:

- All React components â†’ Pure HTML elements
- React state management â†’ JavaScript variables and DOM manipulation
- JSX â†’ Standard HTML
- TypeScript â†’ Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

- React hooks â†’ Standard event listeners and timers

The conversion maintains identical gameplay, visuals, audio, and user experience while removing all build tools and dependencies.
