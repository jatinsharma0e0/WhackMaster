## Development History

This game was successfully converted from a React/TypeScript implementation to pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript while preserving 100% of the original functionality:

- All React components â†’ Pure HTML elements with vanilla JavaScript
- React state management â†’ JavaScript variables and DOM manipulation
- JSX â†’ Standard HTML with dynamic content generation
- TypeScript â†’ Modern JavaScript (ES6+) with proper error handling
- Tailwind CSS â†’ Custom CSS with identical visual design
- React hooks â†’ Standard event listeners and game timers
- Build tools â†’ Direct browser execution

The conversion maintains identical gameplay, visuals, audio, and user experience while eliminating all build tools and external dependencies.
